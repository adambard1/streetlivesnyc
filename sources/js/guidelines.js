        <h3 class="c4" id="h.u5l9qhrsnlik"><span>What they are</span></h3>

        <p class="c10"><span class="c1">These are the community rules we apply to moderate
        content. Comments, posts, pins, and any and all user created information, including
        types not yet defined, that appear on StreetlivesNYC are all called
        &ldquo;Content&rdquo;.</span></p>

        <h3 class="c4" id="h.ews8ditje2z5"><span>Removal of inappropriate content</span></h3>

        <p class="c10"><span class="c1">Content that falls foul of community rules may be
        removed once identified by StreetlivesNYC. The decision about what qualifies as
        inappropriate content is determined solely by StreetlivesNYC, its staff or agents, who
        follow the guidelines listed below. There are links included to further define certain
        sections.</span></p>

        <p class="c8"></p>

        <p class="c10"><span class="c6 c1">Any objectionable or illegal content that remains on
        the site due to an error in application of the guidelines does not invalidate the
        guidelines or lend StreetlivesNYC&rsquo;s approval of any kind to said content. Please
        notify us about content we have overlooked at rights@streetlives.nyc. We do our best to
        apply guidelines equally to all content.</span></p>

        <h3 class="c4" id="h.8u1nm8whkfsc"><span>Latest Revision</span></h3>

        <p class="c10"><span class="c1">These guidelines will change over time, depending on
        the development of StreetlivesNYC, legal requirements, and the needs of the community.
        Your continued use of StreetlivesNYC is deemed an acceptance of the most recent version
        of these guidelines.</span></p>
