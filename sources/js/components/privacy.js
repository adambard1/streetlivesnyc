         <h4>Why Privacy is important to us</h4>
         <p>We believe an individual ought to have the right to choose what they share about themselves with others, revealing what they wish when they choose. This is one way trust is established between people.</p>

         <p>Often, privacy is given away without informed consent; information is collected without the process being clearly understood. There are good reasons not to reveal personal information and we have rules we follow that mean we don't collect personal information about you.</p>

         <p>This does not mean you cannot be identified by having accidentally revealed some key piece of information in a comment you make, but it does mean that the basic exchange of information happens in a way that more accurately reflects our day to day interaction with people.</p>

         <p>There is a great commercial advantage for companies that can identify individuals (by collecting facts, locations and behaviours particular to one person including how they use their money, how they vote, their likes, dislikes and motivations). For example, in order to sell products, services, gain trust or win votes more easily it helps companies to know as much as possible about you.</p>

         <p>This is valuable information. It is collected, analyzed and sold to create a profile of each individual so detailed that most users of technology have themselves become a specialized product for sale.</p>

         <p>In a broad sense this is an invasion of privacy because it is likely you did not realise you were sharing information of that sort. Ultimately it allows manipulation of messages from companies, agencies or individuals to influence you to act in ways that may or may not benefit you, but does benefit the manipulator. This is basically how all advertising works, and the ability to know you as well as possible allows greater degrees of manipulation.</p>

         <p>Unfortunately many common internet services collect such personal information and sell or pass it on; it is a way to generate income. You cannot use these services without having first agreed to their policy of doing so, but it isolates you if you refuse to use the site or app all your friends are on and so it is unlikely you closely read agreements or, even if you do, it is unlikely that you refuse to agree.</p>
         <h4>StreetlivesNYC does not ask you to personally identify yourself</h4>
         <p>We do not ask you to personally identify yourself. If you choose to reveal who you are, that is your choice, not ours.</p>

         <p>There are laws that state we have to reveal all we know about you in the case of specific criminal offenses that may be tied to user activity, but, we repeat, we cannot know who you are if you use the site anonymously. To learn more about this please write to rights@streetlives.nyc</p>
         <h4>What you post is anonymised</h4>
         <p>No one else can know who created a post via any information we keep. By design, we make sure we cannot ever know who you are unless you have revealed it accidentally through the information you have posted.</p>
         <h4>We do collect anonymised information</h4>
         <p>Why?</p>
         <p>Because it helps us build a better service knowing how users interact with StreetlivesNYC and where and how that interaction takes place. We do not need to know who you are to learn about this.</p>
         <p>We collect…</p>
         <ul>
             <li>The information that users provide to us about different locations</li>
             <li>Users’ (optional) usernames</li>
             <li>The session information in Google Analytics (see below)</li>

         <p>We share…</p>
         <ul>
             <li>The information users provide to us about specific locations</li>
             <li>The comments and content posted in threads tied to specific locations</li>

             <li>About Google Analytics & StreetlivesNYC</li>
             <li>Google Analytics is a tool we use to understand how visitors engage with our site.</li></ul>

         <p>StreetlivesNYC will not, and will not assist or permit any third party to, pass information to Google that Google could use or recognize as personally identifiable information. We do not combine the information collected through the use of Google Analytics with personally identifiable information, and could not. We use the information we get from Google Analytics only to improve this site for your use.</p>

         <p>The information we collect is stated above and in regard to StreetlivesNYC and locations, Google Analytics collects only the IP address assigned to you on the date you visit our site, not your name or other identifying information. An IP address is a temporary digital address specific to the location you are at whenever you are connected to the Internet.</p>

         <p>Although Google Analytics plants a permanent cookie on your web browser to identify you as a unique user the next time you visit this site, the cookie cannot be used by anyone but Google. A cookie is a piece of information that is created by web sites or services you have connected to, and is stored on the phone or in the browser of a computer. It gives you a unique random ID that can only be read by the site that gave you the cookie (in this case, Google) and records when you last looked the site and the IP address you last looked at the site from. You can prevent Google Analytics from recognizing you on return visits to this site by disabling cookies on your browser. This will also prevent StreetlivesNYC using Google Analytics when you use our site.</p>
         <h4>How Google uses data via StreetlivesNYC</h4>
         <p>Google's ability to use and share information collected by Google Analytics about your visits to our site is restricted by the Google Analytics Terms of Service and the Google Privacy Policy.</p>

         <p>Google Analytics collects information such as how often users visit the site, what pages they visit when they do so, and what other sites they used prior to coming to this site. The information is anonymized, as stated above.</p>

         <p>Please see www.google.com/policies/privacy/partners/ for a full explanation of Google’s policy in relation to sites using Google Analytics.</p>
         <h4>Last word</h4>
         <p>StreetlivesNYC is serious about protecting its users’ privacy. If you find any fault with our policy or actions that we can amend to improve privacy, within the reasonable constraint of allowing the site to function as designed to benefit the homeless population, please write to us at rights@streetlives.nyc and we will take appropriate action as soon as possible.</p>
